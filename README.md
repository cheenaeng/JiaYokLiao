This is an inidividual project that aims to incorporate REACT, nodeJS and postgresql 

This app is meant to be mobile responsive and aims to help create reminders to notify users to take their scheduled medications. This would be particularly useful for patients who have a long list of medications and those who have trouble remembering their medications. 

This app aims to provide timely reminders and send push notifications to users when the scheduled time is near. This app is also linked to a database of medication details and would be able to provide useful information for users on certain medications they are taking and this would greatly improve medication compliance and medication safety.
